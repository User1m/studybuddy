StudyBuddy is a web app developed by a team od OSU students.

StudyBuddy is supposed to help facilitate learnig by giving students a place to ask questions and get help from their peers.

I primairly worked on connecting the course catalog's commenting system with each course, the twitter scrapper "#studybuddy," and the contact page.
